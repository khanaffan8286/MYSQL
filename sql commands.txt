1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL commands are used to define or modify the structure of database objects like tables.

CREATE: Creates a new database, table, view, or other object.

ALTER: Modifies an existing database object.

DROP: Deletes an entire database, table, or other object.

TRUNCATE: Deletes all records from a table, but keeps the table's structure. It's faster than DELETE for this purpose.

RENAME: Renames an object.



2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML commands are used to manage data within tables.

INSERT: Adds new rows of data into a table.

UPDATE: Modifies existing data within a table.

DELETE: Deletes rows from a table.  



3. Data Query Language (DQL)
DQL commands are used to retrieve data from a database.

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables. This is the most frequently used SQL command.



4. Data Control Language (DCL)
DCL commands are used to manage user permissions and access control.

GRANT: Gives a user specific privileges to a database object.

REVOKE: Removes a user's privileges from a database object.
