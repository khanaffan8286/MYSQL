( Connection through cmd ( mysql -u root -p ))

1. Sql is structed query language.   

2. To create database 
# syntax ( create database --name;)

3. To show database 
# syntax( show databases;)

4. For using table
# syntax ( use --tablename;)

5. For creating table in database
# syntax ( create table attdence(ID int(5),student_name varchar(255), subject char()))

6. For insertion 
# syntax ( insert into employe(Id,emp_name,salary) values(2,'affan',2000);)

7. For getting data from tables 
# syntax ( select *from tablename;)

8. For getting specific colomn 
# syntax ( select colomnname from tablename)

// for deleting column from the table use this
(  ALTER TABLE TABLE_NAME DROP COLUMN COLUMN_NAME ; )


9. not null its use to show that the value of any entity is not null 
# syntax ( create table emp (emp_id int(5) not null ); )

10 . Defualt Constrant its use to create a default value of column or entity 
# syntax ( create table emp ( emp_age int(5) not null default 18, emp_name varchar(255) not null default  'undefined' );  )

11. Alter in sql it's use to modify the objects in sql 
#syntax for drop ( alter table emp drop column emp_id; )
#syntax for add  ( alter table emp add emp_age int(5) not null)

12. Alter command for modify , change , rename ;
#syntax ( alter table employe modify emp_id int(6) not null default 7; )
#syntax ( alter table employe change emp_id emp_ID int(5) not null default 5 ;)
#syntax ( alter table employe rename table_name to table_name;)

13. primary key 
#syntax ( create table student (Roll_no int(5) not null , Name varchar(255), primary key(Roll_no) );)
#syntax ( alter table employe_details add primary key (emp_id);)
#syntax ( ALTER TABLE STUDENT DROP PRIMARY KEY;)

14. Auto increment 
#syntax (create table student (std_id int not null auto_increment , std_name varchar(255) not null , primary key (std_id));   )


15. Where cluse its use find the particular data
#syntax (SELECT emp_name FROM autodata WHERE emp_id=2;)

16. update data in sql 
#syntax (UPDATE autodata SET emp_address='pune' WHERE emp_id=1;)

16. delete data in sql 
#syntax (DELETE FROM table_name where id=2;)


17. SQL aggregate functions are functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They are commonly used with the GROUP BY clause to perform calculations on groups of rows.

Common Aggregate Functions
COUNT(): Counts the number of rows in a set.

SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;

SUM(): Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.

SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;

AVG(): Calculates the average value of a numeric column.

SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

MAX(): Finds the highest value in a column.

SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;

MIN(): Finds the lowest value in a column.

SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;


18. The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a SELECT statement in a specific order. You can sort by one or more columns in either ascending or descending order.

#(syntax) ( select * from table_name order by table_cloumn asc/desc)

19. The DISTINCT clause is used to return only unique values from a selected column or a set of columns. It removes duplicate rows from the result set.

SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY added_date DESC LIMIT 5;

20. Concat this function used to merge two column or words for ex: select concat ('khan','affan');

21. Foreign key ( foreign key is a column in a table that point to the primary key another table)
ex: if we have customer table and product table both custmoer that one column in custmoer table is primary key and that column is foreign key product table )  custmoer cid   product cid 
Syntax : 
       { we have customer table having ( cid name phone ) 
         now we creating new table with customer primary key cid  
        CREATE TABLE product (pid INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , pname VARCHAR(255) , orderdate date ,
        (now here you write the foreign key that you wanted to set you can write anything you want) cid INT , foreign key (cid) refrences customer(cid));

22. Joins ( joins is used to combine column from two or more tables based on the releted column between them usulally a primary key and a foreign key)

There are manly 4 types in joins

1. INNER JOIN	Returns records that have matching values in both tables.Not showing which having empty value in other column.
syntax: SELECT * FROM customer INNER JOIN product on cunstomer.cid = product.cid ;  if wanted any specific column use where   ( where customer.cid=2;)

2. LEFT JOIN	Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right.
Syntax: SELECT * FROM customer LEFT JOIN product on customer.cid = prioduct.cid; -> it will show everything you having left table customer with all row col if you have empty row column it will also sow you;

3. RIGHT JOIN	Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left.
Syntax: SELECT * FROM customer RIGHT JOIN product on customer.cid = prioduct.cid;->it will show everything you having right table product with all

4. FULL JOIN	Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
Synatx : SELECT * FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;


5. CROSS JOIN (The "Everything" Join)
A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian Product of the two tables. This means it matches every single row from Table A with every single row from Table B.
Syntax : SELECT * FROM customer CROSS JOIN product; - > it will combile every column with other column all possibilty will come here.


23. TRUNCATE ( It is used to removed all the rows from the table in a single command )
Synatx : TRUNCTE TABLE customer;


24. ALIASES ( In sql aliases is used to write the temparary name to table or column )
Synatx : SELECT id as customer_identety from customer;
